    <ul>
      <li>Here is a list item block, which is part of the &lt;ul &gt; </li>
    </ul>
    <p>these are block elements.  Think of text inside a box.  The box has some default character.  By default, the box will take up all the space available from its starting point all the way to right, as far as it can.</p>

  <div class="two">
    <p>The width of this division block is 900px</p>
    <p class="box_properties"> block elements are given some box properties.  These properties allow you to manipulate the shape of the box and give you creativity with design.  Here, we see the properties of width, height, padding, border, and margin.</p>
    <p class="box_property">
      For this block element, the darker blue line is the border.  The lighter shade blue is the background color of the text.  It's shape is defined by padding (the space from the edge of the text to the border) and box size--the width and height of the text box.
