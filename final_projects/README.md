# PROJECTS
## Project 1: JSConf Website
The goal was to reproduce [the following web page](https://web.archive.org/web/20201124213242/http://2014.jsconfbr.org/#sponsors) as closely as possible. As of Feb 2021, the above web page seems to have been taken down. In response to this change, the link references an archived version of the page at the Wayback Machine, which I used for the project.

### Launch School Guide for Project 1
  - Skip any animation.
  - Skip the Google Maps section.
  - Make sure you implement links as links (you can use "#" as the href)
  - Make sure you see an appropriate mouse pointer when you hover over linkable items.
  - Make sure you implement the rollover effects in the Speakers section (feel free to use lorem ipsum text here).
  - Make sure you duplicate the narrow strip of gray at the top of the page.
  - Make sure you duplicate the fixed positioning of the navigation bar.
  - Implement responsive features. Almost all sections of the page change at different widths. Don't forget to check them all. In particular, pay attention to the layout of photos in the Speakers section, and the format of the individual sessions in the Schedule section.
  - Note that the Sponsors section is a bit tricky due to inconsistencies. Don't stress too much about the exact appearance of this section.
  - Use semantic HTML wherever possible. In particular, take a closer look every time you're tempted to use a <div> or <span>.
  - Try to avoid over-qualified selectors. For instance, do you need to say main p em.green when .green is all you need?
  - Make sure your HTML markup passes the W3C Validator.
  - Make sure your CSS passes the W3C CSS Validator.
  - Consider using an HTML or CSS linter (see the Install Software assignment) to identify potentially troublesome HTML and CSS.
  - Inspect your work with several browsers if you can, including mobile browsers.
  - Use blink comparisons to identify discrepancies.

## Project: Todo List 

The goal for this project was to build a Todo List manager using HTML and CSS. We were not to use any JavaScript, or to use any enhanced forms of HTML or CSS. We were asked for it to not be fully functional -- you won't be able to select different todo lists, won't be able to add or delete todos, and won't be able to mark todos as complete. However, one should be able to view the popup modal used for adding new todos, and the responsive hamburger should work to show and hide the navigation bar when the browser's width is less than 768 pixels wide.

I've provided some `.png` files for comparison.

### Launch School General Requirements for Project:
- Use standard HTML and CSS exclusively. Do not use Javascript or any HTML or CSS extensions, add-ons, or preprocessors.
- You may use Flex, Grid, floats, or positioning as needed and desired in the project.
- Your project doesn't have to connect to a server or database, but it should include the HTML that it would otherwise need: provide anchors, form controls, and actions where necessary. You can use a URL of # in tags that require URLs.
- Your HTML markup should pass the W3C HTML validator. You may ignore warnings about browser-specific attributes like autocapitalize and autocorrect.
- Your CSS should pass the W3C CSS validator.
- Check the appearance of your work on multiple browsers.
- Note that some browsers use border-radius: 5px to give rounded corners to the 3 drop-down boxes, but others do not. Your submission should show square corners regardless of which browser the grader uses.
- Use the design files to determine width, height, margins, and padding for elements (see below for colors and fonts). The design files show the project at a fixed screen width, but your project should stretch or shrink horizontally as the width changes. The navigation column should be fixed width, but the main todo list is the part that varies in width.
- If you do not have access to Photoshop or a viable alternative, you may use the provided PNG files instead. You can measure some aspects of the PNG files using most PNG viewers (like Mac's Preview program). Try to estimate the sizes of fonts, margins, padding, and other items as best you can. We'll be looking for visual differences. A blink comparison should help you get a close match for the design.
- The state of the page you build should match those of the above screenshots. For example, there should be 9 Todo items in the main area with 3 of those marked as complete.
- Please zip all your files (including the README.md if present) and include it as an attachment.
