# Projects

## 01 Flex Project
This uses Flex to layout a partially completed web page. It gives gives a general idea of how to use Flex.
Flex and Grid naturally work in concert. This contrived project intentionally restricts the use of Grid to purposely use only Flex.

## 02 Grid Project
This project takes the same layout but instead of using Flex, it uses Grid only. 


## 04 Gallery Projects
### Fluid Photo Gallery
This project contains a single photo at the full width of the column, followed by four smaller thumbnail images in a single row below it. 
All of these adjust their widths to take up the same percentage width no matter what the main gallery width is.
### Photo Gallery With Media Queries
This adds some media queries to adjust the design for both smaller and larger screens.
Conditions of photo gallery:
  - four thumbnails per line when the window is at least 900 pixels wide. 
  - Three per line when the window is between 600 and 899 pixels. 
  - Two per line when the window is narrower than 600 pixels. 
  - Extra layout when window width is 1280px.

Included also (gallery2-grid) is the same conditions but created using Grid.
