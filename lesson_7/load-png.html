2. Set the width and height of your browser as precisely as possible to match the width and height of the PNG file.
3. Create your HTML file and load it in a separate tab.
4. Toggle your browser tabs back and forth between the files (Ctrl-Tab and Shift-Ctrl-Tab work with most browsers).
5. Observe the differences between the design file and your file. 6. Make corrections in your file.
7. Return to step 5 until your files match as well as possible.  -->
