# Summary
This first course in the Front-end curriculum will deep dive into the basic building blocks of client side programming: HTML and CSS. We'll cover many aspects of front end development, including converting design files to web pages, writing semantic HTML, building fluid layouts and responsive design. We will cap off the course with projects that will reinforce the concepts that you've learned throughout the course and end with a project that will familiarize you with a typical workflow for projects built from the ground-up.
